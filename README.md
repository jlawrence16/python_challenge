# python_challenge

In this project I was taked with analysis two seperate set of data (PyBank and PyPoll). For both data sets the results of the analyssi are printed to text files in the 'Analysis' sub-foler

"PyBank' Dataset

I created a Python script that analyzes the financial records of a small company to calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

"PyPoll" Dataset

I created a Python script that analyzes the votes from an election in a small town and calculates each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote
